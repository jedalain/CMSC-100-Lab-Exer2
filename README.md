Steps on creating a GitHub Page:
1. Go to your chosen repository's settings, and head to the "Pages" part
2. From the "Build and deployment" section, in the "Branch" part, choose the main branch from the drop down and click save
3. Go back to the "Code" page of your repository and wait for he "Deployments" to appear on the bottom-right of the page.
4. Once it appears, open it and you'll see the link to your deployedsite.

My key takeaways from this exercise are: 
- that it is possible to deploy a website for free, without paying a single cent. 
- it is hard to create a webpage from scratch within just two hours
